# Find the Errors
In this program, you will debug a program that contains the following errors:
1. Compile time bugs
1. Run time bugs
1. Style guide violations

## main.cpp
1. Visually inspect the code and fix any code statements that do not follow the style guide (e.g., spacing and indentation).
1. Try compiling the program to find out what errors the compiler finds.
1. Find and fix the compile time error(s).
1. Once the program compiles, try running it to see whether it outputs the expected results.
1. Find and fix any bug(s) in the program that are causing incorrect results to be output.

# Hints
1. The compiler outputs the line number and column of the error if a compile time error is encountered
   e.g., `main.cpp:27:37` indicates an error in your code on line 27, column 37
1. Make sure the username output includes the quotation marks as well as both of the initials that you type for middle name and last name

# Sample Output
```
Enter your first name: tuffy
Enter the first initial of your middle name: t
Enter the first initial of your last name: t
Your username is "tuffytt"
```
